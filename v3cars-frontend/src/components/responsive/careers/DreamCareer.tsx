                        We follow a flat organizational structure, where every team member
                        uses their unique strengths and skills to help the company achieve
                        its goals. We also take time to share our skills and learning among
                        ourselves. Meanwhile, we promote a culture of continuous upskilling
                        to empower our team members so they can also achieve their goals.
                        When every team member grows, V3Cars grows automatically.

                        We are helping car buyers objectively select the most suitable car
                        down to the variant and engine-transmission combo based on their
                        needs, budget and preferences.

                        Car buying can be stressful. Too many cars. Too many variants. A lot
                        of engine-transmission combos. And far too much misinformation. We
                        want to make the car buying journey enjoyable.

                        We are using data to build a car recommendation engine, which will

                        and feature preferences while also prioritizing the ownership
                        experience and value-for-money quotient.
