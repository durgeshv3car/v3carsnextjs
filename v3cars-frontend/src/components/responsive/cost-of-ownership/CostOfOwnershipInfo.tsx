                How to Read Cost of Ownership When Comparing Cars
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
                A car that looks affordable at first glance may not stay that way once
                fuel bills, service charges and taxes are factored into the equation.
                Comparing cost of ownership helps you understand the real money you’ll
                spend during your time with the vehicle.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
                Some models deliver excellent mileage and low scheduled service bills,
                making them inexpensive to run despite a higher sticker price. Others
                may seem budget-friendly upfront but cost significantly more in the long
                run because of higher fuel consumption or heavier service parts.
            </p>

                Use this comparison to see how each car behaves over a full ownership
                period. A balanced decision comes from weighing both the upfront
                purchase cost and the recurring expenses that follow every month.

                Choosing the Smarter Car Based on Ownership Cost
            </h2>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
                When two cars fall within a similar price bracket, your final choice
                often comes down to how much they cost to own and maintain over time.
                Start by checking which car demands fewer service visits and lower
                maintenance parts. Then look at fuel consumption — even a small
                difference in mileage can add up to a meaningful saving across years of
                driving.
            </p>

            <p className="mb-4 leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
                It also helps to consider the type of usage you expect. A frequent
                highway commuter may prioritise efficiency and lower running cost, while
                a city-only driver may value compact size and lower insurance premiums.
            </p>

            <p className="leading-relaxed text-gray-400">
                This comparison gives you a clear, practical view of how each car fits
                into your routine and your budget, helping you make a decision that
                remains sensible long after the purchase.
