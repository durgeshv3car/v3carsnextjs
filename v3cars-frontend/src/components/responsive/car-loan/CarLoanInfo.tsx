      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What is a Car Loan?</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Banks, non-banking financial companies (NBFCs), and other financial institutions in India extend car loans to individuals for financing the purchase of a car, whether new or used, for personal or commercial purposes.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Lenders determine the car loan amount, interest rate, repayment tenure, and other conditions based on factors such as the borrower’s credit score, income, loan amount, and tenure. Eligibility criteria, encompassing age, income, employment status, and credit score, must be met by applicants. Additionally, borrowers are required to furnish documents like identity proof, address proof, income proof, and relevant car-related paperwork.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Repayment of these car loans typically occurs through Equated Monthly Installments (EMIs) throughout the loan tenure. EMIs comprise both the principal amount and the interest charged by the lender. Lenders may also impose processing fees, prepayment charges, and other fees that contribute to the overall borrowing cost.
      </p>
      <p className="mb-6">
        Before securing a car loan, it is crucial to compare terms from different lenders. Carefully read and comprehend the loan agreement, and gain a clear understanding of the stipulated terms and conditions. Moreover, ensuring that the EMI aligns with one’s budget and repayment capacity is essential before committing to a car loan.

      <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold mb-3">What is Car Loan Eligibility in India?</h2>
      <p className="mb-2">
        Several factors contribute to determining car loan eligibility in India. Lenders evaluate applications considering various aspects of the applicant’s profile. Key factors include:
      </p>

      <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-1 mb-4">
        <li><strong>Income:</strong> Most lenders set a minimum monthly income requirement, typically ranging from Rs. 15,000 to Rs. 20,000. The specific income criteria may vary based on the lender and the car’s price.</li>
        <li><strong>Employment Status:</strong> Lenders prefer applicants with stable employment and a consistent income source. Self-employed individuals might need to furnish additional documentation to showcase income stability.</li>
        <li><strong>Credit Score:</strong> A crucial determinant, a credit score of 750 or above is generally considered good and enhances the likelihood of loan approval. A lower credit score may result in a higher interest rate or potential rejection.</li>
        <li><strong>Age:</strong> Applicants within the age bracket of 21 to 60 years are typically eligible for a car loan.</li>
        <li><strong>Financial Obligations:</strong> Lenders assess existing financial commitments, such as loans or credit card debts, as they can impact the applicant’s capacity to repay the car loan.</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mb-6">
        Additionally, lenders may consider factors like the loan amount, down payment, and the car’s price when evaluating car loan eligibility. It is advisable to check with the specific lender or refer to their website for detailed information on eligibility criteria and requirements tailored to their offerings.
